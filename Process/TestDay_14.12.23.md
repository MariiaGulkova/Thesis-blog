## 14.12.23 Test day

### Reflection 

So for me, the main aim of the test day was to find out if my story was clear and understandable, if it had any problems, etc.

During the testing process it became clear that the essence of the story was clear to the audience. But there were some common points. The story needs more context and variety. As the main character is a child, the vocabulary should be appropriate to the time period. 

There are also some interesting ideas - using the personal diary as a resource for where stories come from. It would also be interesting to compare how the possibility of influence varies with age and circumstances. 

I also got some interesting examples, namely the game "The Stanley Parable", the film "Good Bye, Lenin", Ord (game)!

## Before lunch

### Brief insights from the interviews after the persona has gone through the story

### Person 1

- the goal of the story is clear

- "Comsomol" is not clear

- Moving of the pic on the background is confusing

- I need to clarify that its from real interview

- too much text

### Person 2

- the goal of the story is clear

- Moment with year (1981) is not clear

- I need to clarify that its from real interview

- too much text

### Person 3

- the goal of the story is clear

- in the beginning of the story he didnt get where the story is happening

- too much text on the slides 

### Person 4

- the goal of the story is clear

- can be cool to have #soundfeedback

- he liked the idea of having no choice

- Examples: The Stanley Parable, Ord (game)

- The amount of text is not an issue for him, as he has seen examples of games where the experience is all about the text

## After lunch

### Person 5,6,7

- the goal of the story is clear

- the vocabulary is too modern and not really appropriate for a child

- "Guess what" too much

- It would be cool to have a comparison of the impact on children, where the psyche is more flexible, and humans in adulthood, where it's quite difficult/impossible to change a person's mind

- Example: the film "Good Bye, Lenin"

- Can be cool to have experience as a "Journal" with different stories

- to make context of the story more clear

- Target audience
