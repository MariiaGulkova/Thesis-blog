## Starting point

I interviewed different groups of people about propaganda, from the Soviet Union and from today's social media users. And based on the data from these interviews, for the test day I wanted to create interactive stories, with visual support. 

The first plan was to give the person a choice at the beginning of the experience to follow a different narrative line. But due to time constraints, I decided to focus on one story, based on an excerpt from an interview - "I was 4 years old, I went to kindergarten, we drew America, and I drew skyscrapers and nuclear bombs in between - that's how I imagined the United States of America".
