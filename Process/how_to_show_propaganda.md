"The story is told on behalf of one of the residents of the town, which prohibits the maintenance of cats, and then dogs of any color other than brown. Cats and dogs of other colors are prescribed to be put to sleep. The hero discusses this news with his friend Charlie, but it soon turns out that the brown color is spreading even further: the only newspaper in the city is Brown News, other newspapers are closed, as they allowed themselves to critically discuss the order to eradicate non-brown dogs and cats. Many publishing houses and books were also banned. The word "brown" has become the main epithet for all trustworthy phenomena.

One day, when he's going to visit Charlie, the hero sees that he's being arrested. He learns that this is due to the fact that Charlie once had a black dog, and everyone who (or even whose relatives) used to have not had brown animals to be arrested. The story ends with the fact that one day at dawn a knock is heard at the door of the main character - who himself once held a white cat with black spots."

The novel is unanimously perceived as a "manifesto against political unanimity, a metaphor for "brown shirts" - a nickname given by the Nazi SA. According to the Afisha columnist, Pavloff's book is "about how easy it is to cover the country with a cap of fascism.".

Konstantin Milchin notes that the plot novel "goes back to the famous poem by Martin Niem√∂ller "When they came for the Communists, I was silent..." Only in Pavloff it all starts with cats and dogs.".
