### How to write from kids perspective:

#### Summarizing the key points for my work:

Many writers mistakenly assign adult-like speech to children in their stories, creating unrealistic dialogue. This error is evident when young characters use complex sentences or express concepts beyond their cognitive and linguistic development. For example, a two-year-old in a novel was unrealistically portrayed asking about moving house, a concept and sentence structure too advanced for their age. Instead, depicting a childâ€™s reaction through actions or simpler phrases like "Me not go" would be more authentic.

Another common mistake is attributing adult reasoning to children, as seen in a scene where a six-year-old supposedly shields her face from the heat with a calculated intention, which is beyond her developmental capability. A more realistic approach would involve simpler expressions of feelings and more instinctual actions. Additionally, complex emotional understanding and expressions, like a six-year-old discussing their mother's abandonment with adult-like insight, are also inaccurately portrayed in some writings. This emphasizes the need for writers to understand and reflect the actual cognitive and linguistic abilities of children at different ages.

Understanding child development, specifically the cognitive stages outlined by psychologist Jean Piaget, can greatly improve the authenticity of child dialogue in writing. Observing and listening to real children's conversations can provide valuable insights into their thought processes and speech patterns. By focusing on age-appropriate speech and behavior, writers can create more realistic and relatable child characters, enhancing the overall quality of their storytelling.

### Voice interaction:

In Japan, voice interaction gained traction with the Nintendo Family Computer (Famicom), which featured a built-in microphone, leading to voice-enabled games. The approach to voice interaction diverged in the following years, with Japanese developers embracing conversational interaction and North American developers focusing on voice commands. The karaoke genre emerged as a notable success in voice interaction, while the introduction of Microsoft Kinect later brought voice interaction closer to mainstream gaming.

Recently, independent developers have been pioneering voice interaction in games, especially on computer and mobile platforms, marking a new phase of innovation in voice-enabled gaming.
