Interactivity in games is designed to deepen the player's experience and immersion in the game's story, mechanics, and environment. Successful games like Halo and Rock Band achieve high levels of immersion through controllers, visuals, and physically interactive instruments, respectively. Developers must center interactivity around a game's unique features and understand the different types of interactions—cerebral, emotional, and physical—that can enhance the gaming experience.

Interactions in games can be categorized into several types, including touch through button presses and haptic feedback, audio through sound effects and voice, and even smell and taste in more niche applications. Sight remains a crucial aspect, with modern graphics and virtual reality offering deep visual immersion. Intellectual and emotional interactions are also key, with games like Portal and The Sims engaging players through puzzles and simulated relationships.

Advanced interactive elements like eye tracking in VR and the inclusion of choice in games allow players to influence game events and storylines, adding depth to the gaming experience. Consistency in interactivity is essential; it should enhance the game's unique aspects without overwhelming the player. A well-designed game focuses on essential interactions that align with its core features, increasing the chances of success and player satisfaction.
