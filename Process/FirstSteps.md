### What I want to explore

How can I transform people's experience about the propaganda - in Soviet Union and Nowadays in Social Media - in storytelling and create a interactive visual experience?

### Methods

I want to experiment with Data from my interviews, which I have done during my thesis, to use them as a base for a narrative story and to try different ways to visualize them.

### Test Day

During the test day, I want to test if my narrative in Twine works and if it is clear and maybe to test possibilities for visualising.

### Needs

I will use illustrations From Midjourney/Twine/Figma/not sure yet for the test day

### The next steps

Writing, drawing, experimenting. 

### Samples

Prompt - "imagine I`m a soviet union propagandist. In 1987, in winter, I was on rearmament. We were at the stage of combat alignment. I was the commander of a separate anti-aircraft-missile division. It's minus 35 outside and it's night. There is a preparation for night fighting."
