## Okay, lets go

### What I want to explore

How can I transform people experience about the propaganda - in Soviet Union and Nowadays in Social Media - in storytelling and create a interactive visual experience

### Methods

I want to experiment with Data from my interviews, which I have done during my thesis, to use them as a basement for a narrative story. And to try different ways to visualize them 

### Test Day

In Test Day I want to test if my narrative in Twine works and if they are clear and maybe to test possibilities for visual part

### Needs

Ill use illustrations/Twine/Figma/not sure yet for the test day

### The next steps

Writing, drawing, experimenting. 

### Samples

Prompt - "imagine I`m soviet union propagandist, 1987, winter, I was on rearmament, we were at the stage of combat alignment, I was the commander of a separate anti-aircraft-missile division. It's minus 35 outside, it's night. There is a preparation for night fighting."
