## Work in Progress

### Poster

During the holidays I started experimenting with environments in unreal engine to understand the mechanics and prepare material for the poster, as I wanted to use 3d graphics as part of the visuals. I was inspired by ### <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ4gSKZh6do&t=1161s">pwnisher</a>

After modulating the background in Unreal Engine, I composed the composition with additional details in Photoshop. The girl symbolises a character in the story and the doors are a kind of reference to Alice in Wonderland, but in my case they are different ways of developing the narrative and different ways of visualising and communicating.

### Jury

- Based on the data from the test day and what I'd done for the poster, I continued to work on the story - adding a new arc, adapting the vocabulary to 80s British English. I used chat jpt to do this, but ideally, if I still have this task ahead of me, I'd like to train my own text date bot, as chat jpt needed constant tweaking and checking the meaning of words. 

- For the visuals, I tried to continue working in 3d, but my computer went on strike, so based on the discussion with the professor, I decided to try to create a short 2d animation, black and white, with simple shapes, as 3d itself doesn't leave much room for imagination. I still want to try 3d, or maybe touch designer, to have the possibility create a unique interaction 

- Since I wanted my narrators to sound and have a voice, I implemented the voice created with the AI tool into the 2D animation.

### Jury Feedback

- To be more risky with decisions in the project, to be more braver

- Give a feeling of censorship

- To be more involved in narration
