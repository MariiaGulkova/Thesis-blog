### Dear Esther: Landmark Edition

Pluses:

- Atmospheric Experience: The game is praised for its immersive atmosphere, enhanced by a compelling soundtrack and a visually detailed island to explore. The live strings and choirs contribute to an eerie yet calming ambiance that's consistent throughout the game​​.

- Narrative Depth: The mysterious narration and the way the story unfolds as you explore the island can be deeply engaging for players interested in story-driven experiences. The narrative is intentionally vague, encouraging players to piece together the story and interpret it in their own way​​.

- Visuals and Sound Design: The game's visuals and sound design, particularly in the cave sections, are highlighted as stunning. The immersive sound design and graphical attention to detail, especially underground, create spectacular scenes​​.

- Developer's Commentary: The Landmark Edition includes a developer's commentary mode that offers interesting insights into the game's development, adding value to the experience for fans and newcomers alike​​​​.

Minuses:

- Limited Interactivity: The game's lack of puzzles, platforms, enemies, or interactive elements has sparked debate about its status as a video game. This might not appeal to those looking for traditional gameplay mechanics​​.
Short Duration: The game is relatively short, with playthroughs averaging around 90 minutes. This, combined with little replay value, can be a downside for players seeking longer gaming experiences​​​​.

- Pace of Gameplay: The slow movement speed throughout the game, with no option to sprint and occasional reductions to a crawl, can make exploration tedious, especially for players used to more dynamic action​​.

- Niche Appeal: The game's slow-moving, narrative-focused style might not cater to all tastes. If you didn't enjoy similar narrative-driven games by The Chinese Room, "Dear Esther" might also not appeal to you​​.

### What Remains of Edith Finch

Pluses:

- Narrative and Storytelling: The game is praised for its innovative storytelling techniques, including vignettes that vary in tone and gameplay style, reflecting the diverse lives and tragic ends of the Finch family members. Each story segment offers a different gameplay experience, from photographing a hunting trip to experiencing a fever dream, making the narrative deeply engaging and emotionally resonant​​.

- Environmental Immersion: The game's setting, the Finch family house, is noted for its detailed and imaginative design, filled with secret passages and rooms that reflect the personalities of their inhabitants. This contributes to a rich, immersive experience as players explore the house and uncover its many stories​​.

- Innovative Gameplay: "What Remains of Edith Finch" is commended for its inventive gameplay mechanics that closely tie into its storytelling, such as using a controller to mimic real-life actions like winding a music box or opening a can of peaches. These elements enhance the connection between the player and the game's characters​​.

Minuses:

- Exploration Mechanics: While the exploration aspect is a key part of the game, navigating through the Finch house can sometimes feel cumbersome, especially when moving beyond the first floor through secret rooms and crawlspaces designed more for narrative purposes than realism​​.

- Genre Specificity: As a game often categorized under the "walking simulator" genre, its focus on narrative over traditional gameplay mechanics might not appeal to players looking for more action-oriented or puzzle-solving gameplay. The game's emphasis is on story and atmosphere, which might not satisfy those seeking a challenge or more interactive elements​​.

- Overall, "What Remains of Edith Finch" is celebrated for its storytelling, atmospheric setting, and innovative gameplay, but it's important to note its narrative-focused approach and exploration mechanics may not cater to all gaming preferences.

### Scanner Sombre

Like Introversion’s older games, Scanner Sombre is an experiment centered around a singular idea and mechanic—in this case, LIDAR. You really do spend the entirety of the game in a dark cave, your sole interaction with the environment just mapping its edges so you can walk through.
I’d call it a gimmick game, were it not so well-executed. I’m also tempted to call it a horror game, but it’s not. Not really. It borrows some horror elements, especially from the found footage genre, but most of the dread is inherent to the setting itself.
There’s a palpable sense of claustrophobia to Scanner Sombre’s cave, encouraged by the stark audio design. A rushing river, the sound of your feet scuffling against gravel, or wind blowing mournfully through narrow passages is all the more haunting when you can’t see them clearly. Is that a stream you’re about to wade into or a river echoing from hundreds of feet below? Hard to tell.

These titles underscore the profound potential of video games as a medium for immersive storytelling.

I learned the power of innovative storytelling and unique gameplay to create deeply engaging and memorable experiences. The use of environmental storytelling, varied storytelling techniques and inventive mechanics can greatly enhance immersion and make each game a unique journey. The emotional impact of well-crafted stories, combined with artistic visual and aural elements, underscores the potential of video games as a compelling medium for narrative exploration.

I learned the importance of balancing innovation with accessibility and clarity in game design. While unique gameplay and storytelling approaches can set a game apart, they must be intuitive and satisfying for a broad audience. Ensuring a coherent narrative and providing enough content and interactivity are crucial to avoid leaving players feeling confused or dissatisfied. These challenges highlight the need for thoughtful design that takes into account player expectations and the diversity of the gaming community.
