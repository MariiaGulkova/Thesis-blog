Wonderful!

Of course, it's nice to be home, but it's time to get ready for school!

Soooo, big pencil case, cute notebook, sweet candy, boring textbook.....

I need something else...

But it's not important!

[[Really?|Nextone]]

I'm finally gonna see my friends today!~

We're planning something BIG at school!

Can you guess or maybe help?

[[Could you help me pleeease?|Help]]     [[Let me think!|Guess]]

——————————————-

Aaaaaand, drum roll..... WE'RE GONNA PLAY ON A NEW YEAR'S EVE SHOW! 

YAAAAAAY! 

We're gonna be the bravest of the Pioneers and Komsomol!

And we will PUF PUF the evil that's trying to steal the New Year! 

[[Woooow|Reaction]]

———————————————

But one thing I can't understand... When I told Daddy about this SUPER PUPER EVENT last week, he said like:

"Pioneers and Komsomol, damn it, they are part of 'Communist Mafia'". 

Huuuuh, what's the mafia is?~ Do you know?

[[Yes, of course I know!|Yep]]    [[I have nooo idea|Nope]]

————————————————-

You see! 

But I feared to ask my dad, he was so red and angry.....

And then I decided to ask my teacher in school, 'Why are the Komsomol and Pioneers like a mafia?' And guess what? 

My teacher got really mad! She said, 'Don't ever say that again!' and even called my parents to school. Dad was super angry at me, but I don't get it, why?

And the teacher told me that I wouldn’t be able to come to school for a WEEK!!!

[[I cant believe it | Next]]

—————————————————-

Yes, I couldn't believe too! 

But YAY finally I'm coming back! 

I'm gonna be in the show cause Daddy told the teacher he likes our country lots and he gave her a BIIIG, BIIIG bottle of Dom Perin! 

The teacher was not angry anymore!
