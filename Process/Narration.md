[[Woooow|Reaction]]

———————————————

But one thing I can't understand... When I told Daddy about this SUPER PUPER EVENT last week, he said like:

"Pioneers and Komsomol, damn it, they are part of 'Communist Mafia'". 

Huuuuh, what's the mafia is?~ Do you know?

[[Yes, of course I know!|Yep]]    [[I have nooo idea|Nope]]

————————————————-

You see! 

But I feared to ask my dad, he was so red and angry.....

And then I decided to ask my teacher in school, 'Why are the Komsomol and Pioneers like a mafia?' And guess what? 

My teacher got really mad! She said, 'Don't ever say that again!' and even called my parents to school. Dad was super angry at me, but I don't get it, why?

And the teacher told me that I wouldn’t be able to come to school for a WEEK!!!

[[I cant believe it | Next]]

—————————————————-

Yes, I couldn't believe too! 

But YAY finally I'm coming back! 

I'm gonna be in the show cause Daddy told the teacher he likes our country lots and he gave her a BIIIG, BIIIG bottle of Dom Perin! 

The teacher was not angry anymore!
