### Question

How can I transform people experience about the propaganda - in Soviet Union and Nowdays in Social Media - in storytelling and create a visual experience? 

### Methods

I want to experiment with my interviews, which i have done during my thesis, to try to use them as a basement for narrative stories. And try different ways to visualize them 

### Test Day

In Test Day I want to test narratives in Twine and maybe visuals

### Needs

Ill use illustrations/Twine/Figma for the test day

### The next steps

Writing, drawing, experimenting.
